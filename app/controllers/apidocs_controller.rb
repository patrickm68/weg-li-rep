      The weg.li API allows an authorized user to manage notices, upload photos and notify the authorities.

      The API-KEY can be obtained via the profile page https://www.weg.li/user

      Creating a notice requires creating uploads for each photo previously and uploading the binary data through a presigned URL to the gcloud.

      So in order to create a notice the client needs to follow those steps:
      1. Create a new upload using the filename, the size in bytes of the file, the MD5 base64 Digest of the file and the content-type image/jpeg
      2. Use the response fields 'url' and 'headers' in order to upload the binary data via PUT request
      3. Repeat for every photo
      4. Create notice using signed_id keys of the uploads created as the values to the photos array of the notice
